"""Pull a single OCI layer over plain HTTPS -- no Docker, no daemon, no deps.

`innate-sim assets` must work without Docker: VirtualMars notebooks want
sim/assets and nothing else. The whole protocol for a public GHCR package is
three GETs:

    GET /token?scope=repository:<repo>:pull&service=ghcr.io   -> {"token": ...}
    GET /v2/<repo>/manifests/<ref>                            -> index or manifest
    GET /v2/<repo>/blobs/<digest>                             -> a gzipped tar

A layer blob IS a gzipped tar, so "pull one layer" is that third GET piped into
tarfile. Since sim/Dockerfile.assets gives each subtree its own layer and never
rewrites an earlier one, one blob extracts to a complete subtree -- ~85 MB of
MuJoCo geometry instead of the whole ~156 MB image. The layer digest is the
integrity check, so nothing here needs a side-channel checksum.
