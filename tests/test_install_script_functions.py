"""scripts/install-sim.sh calls only functions it defines.

Shell resolves function names at call time, so deleting one leaves every call
site syntactically perfect and fatal at runtime: `sh -n` passes, shellcheck
passes, and the installer dies on the line that needed it. Refactoring this
script removed six functions that way, each caught by accident.

main() is checked rather than the whole file because it is unambiguous -- one
command per line, no case patterns, no prose -- and it is the spine: every
phase of the install is a call in it.
